# Mapping_Earthquakes

Created a local webpage that shows all the earthquakes within the past 7 days and the tectonic plates around the world. Each earthquake is colored based off their magnitude. There are three different map views that people can use, street view, satellite view, and light view. All map views have the option to toggle on/off earthquakes and tectonic plates.
